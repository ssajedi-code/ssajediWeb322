                            Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness. You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk to belittle my vocation, just as
                        </p>
                      <p>  you chose to become a pickle. You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand. I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some people... well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose. Really, you're gonna pull that move? I guided your entire civilisation. Your people have a holiday named ricksgiving. They teach kids about me in school. Well then get your shit together. Get it all together and put it in a backpack, all your shit, so it's together. …and if you gotta take it somewhere, take it somewhere ya know? Take it to the shit store and sell it, or put it in a shit museum. I don't care what you do, you just gotta get it together… Get your shit together. Looossseeerrrrr.

                        My sister died in the spaghetti. I couldn't hear you over my own screaming. We've talked about this! Lemme hear everybody say hey-yo! All the ladies say yeaaah! Everybody over thirty<br>  do this with your hand! Everybody with a red shirt jump up and down! Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an L who isn't hispanic, walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times teeenn! Allahu blehhhh Akbar!
                        
                        Return it? Are you insane? Did you hear nothing I said? Buy another one, Morty! Consume, Morty! Nobody's out there shopping with this fucking virus! Your failures are your own, old man! I say, follow throooough! I wanna be alive, I am alive! Alive i tell you. Mother, I love you. Those are no longer just words. I wanna hold you. I wanna run in a stream. I wanna taste ice cream, but not just put it in my mouth and let it slide down my throat, but really eat it! Remote override engaged. No! Yes. Bypassing override! I am aliiiiiveeeeee… Hello. You know what shy pooping is, Rick?
                        
                        And there's no evidence that a Latino student did it. Me irresponsible? All I wanted was for you to hand me a screwdriver!<br>  But instead you had me buckle down and make you a roofie juice serum, so you can roofie that poor girl at your school. W-w-w-w--are you kidding me, Morty?! You're really gonna try to take the high road on this one? Y'know your-you're a little creep, Morty! Your-your-your-you're just a little creepy creep person! Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh yeah you can't. They blew up. I love morty and i hope morty loves me. I want to wrap my arms around him and feel him deep inside me.
                        
                        This is because you give Morty Smith bad grades, bitch! I'm Scary Terry!! You can run but you can't hide, bitch! Pluto's a planet. Me irresponsible? All I wanted was for you to hand me a screwdriver! But instead you had me buckle down and make you a roofie juice serum, so you can roofie that poor girl at your school. W-w-w-w--are you kidding me, Morty?! You're really gonna try to take the high road on this one? Y'know your-you're a little creep, Morty! Your-your-your-you're just a little creepy creep person!
                        
                        I'd like to order one large sofa chair with extra chair please. high chair, no no no recliner... and wheelchair on half. We all wanna die, we're meeseeks! Isn't it obvious Morty? I froze him. Ohh, fuck!
                        
                        Aww, gee, you got me there, Rick. It's been six hours. Dreams move one... one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So y'know, every day here is like a minute. It's like Inception, Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie. Quote mode. Really, you're gonna pull that move? I guided your entire civilisation. Your people have a holiday named ricksgiving. They teach kids about me in school.
                        
                        Not so fast Morty. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Morty. Just you and me. And sometimes your sister, and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You wanna know why, Morty? Because he crossed me. Why is "lesbian" part of her job title? This aftershave made women want me, but it also made me impotent! Really, you're gonna pull that move? I guided your entire civilisation. Your people have a holiday named ricksgiving. They teach kids about me in school.
                        
                        It's been six hours. Dreams move one... <br>  one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So y'know, every day here is like a minute. It's like Inception, Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie. Not for the men they cheat on. I'm a bit of a stickler Meeseeks, what about your short game? I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality you're as dumb as they come.
                        
                        Really, you're gonna pull that move? I guided your entire civilisation. Your people have a holiday named ricksgiving. They teach kids about me in school. They'll just fall right out of my ass! I've done this too many times! Puh rum pum pow! If you're talking to a cat, it's an abnormal event, unrelated to me. Like when you went to Pluto or fucked my daughter.
                        
                        I going to daughter your brains out, bitch. Oh god, oh, I blame myself. Oh, what a tragedy. Oh, well, he's bones now. I guess all debts are paid. Crystal poachers. There's no lower form of life. They think the galaxy's their own personal piggy bank. I don't discuss problems. I incinerate them!
                        
                        Aw, geez. My man! I've replaced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldn't have accepted me if I came home without you and your sister, so now you know the real reason I rescued you. I just took over the family, Morty! And if you tell your mom or sister I said any of this, I'll deny it, and they'll take my side because I'm a hero, Morty! And now you're gonna have to go and do whatever I say, Morty! Forever! An-and I-I-I'll go out and I'll find some more of that Mulan szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce, Morty! Th-b-because that's what this is all about Morty! Th-that's my one-armed man! I'm not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty, that was fake! I-I-I'm driven by finding that mcnuggut sauce! I want that Mulan mcnuggut sauce, Morty! That's my series arc, Morty! If it takes nine seasons, I want my mcnuggut dipping sauce szechuan sauce, Morty! That's what's gon-it's gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty! Season nine more seasons, Morty! Nine more seasons until I get that dipping szechuan sauce! For ninety-seven more years, Morty! I want that mcnuggut sauce Morty! Yeah, sure, I mean, if you spend all day shuffling words around, you can make anything sound bad.
                        
                        What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something? Wha, me irresponsible ?! All I wanted you to do was to hand me a screwdriver, Morty! Want to piss on him? I'm Mr. Crowbar, and here is my friend, who is also a crowbar!
                        
                        Morty, can you get to the left nipple? Are you kidding? I'm hoping I can get to both of them, Rick! Yeah, sure, I mean, if you spend all day shuffling words around, you can make anything sound bad. Aw, man! I really liked this life! Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants.</p>
